# Intro

As the Chemistry and Radiological Controls Assitant on the USS San Francisco Moored Training Ship, I oversee the maintentance, technician training, and overall operations surrounding chemistry and radiological controls of the nuclear reactor plant. Previously, I served onboard the USS Columbia based out of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. 

I am interested in pursuing a career in next-generation command and control systems and electronic warfare methods.
